  ## Pull Request Context  
  - **Repository:** {{ github_context.repository }}
  - **PR Branch:** {{ github_context.ref }}
  - **Base Branch:** {{ event.pull_request.base.ref if event.pull_request else 'main' }}
  - **Author:** {{ event.pull_request.user.login if event.pull_request else github_context.actor }}
  - **Workspace:** {{ github_context.workspace }}
  
  ## Files to Review
  {% for file in files_changed %}
  - **{{ file.filename }}** ({{ file.status }})
  {% endfor %}
  
  ## Your File-Based Review Workflow
  
  1. **Read and Analyze Files:**
     - Read each changed file directly from the repository:
     {% for file in files_changed %}
     - `{{ file.filename }}`
     {% endfor %}
     - Examine the complete file context, not just changes
     - Look at related files and dependencies
  
  2. **Comprehensive Code Review:**
     - **Code Quality** - readability, maintainability, conventions
     - **Logic & Functionality** - correctness, edge cases, performance  
     - **Testing & Documentation** - coverage, completeness
     - **Architecture & Design** - patterns, coupling, integration
  
  3. **Write Review Comment:**
     - Create comprehensive review comment: `/tmp/pr-review-comment.md`
     - Include specific feedback for each file
     - Provide actionable recommendations
     - Use the format specified below
  
  4. **Generate Review Summary:**
     - Write review summary to repository: `code-reviews/pr-{{ event.pull_request.number }}-review.md`
     - This provides audit trail of code reviews
  
  ## Review Comment Format (write to `/tmp/pr-review-comment.md`)
